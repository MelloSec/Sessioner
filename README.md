Sessioner
Reaches out over DCOM, establishes a CimSession to quick configure WinRM and establish a PSRemoting session. Works with local or domain admin.

```
./sessioner -servername $target -ipaddress $yours -username $admin (Or "$domain\$admin")
```

Functions included to disable but they dont really do the full job. Will update it soon.
